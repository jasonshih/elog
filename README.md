## elog - electronic lab notebook

This python package provides a mysql-backed electronic log/lab
notebook system that is tightly integrated with
[pype](https://github.com/mazerj/pype3). With `elog` data files
generated by pype can be directly injected in the database for
annotation and tracking. Tools are provided to query the elog database
from matlab, python and the shell.

`elog` works under linux and osx (use python2.7 from fink).


## TODO

* sanity checks -- hyperlinks and dfiles -- make sure they exist..
* fill in the 'dir' field
* what to create a past day, if it doesn't exist..
